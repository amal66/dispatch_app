# Dispatch App

This app was created for the AT&T Firefighters hackathon. It is a React
app that assists overpowered 911 operators during mass emergencies like
public shootings. When 911 operators are busy and there is a mass emergency,
individuals who dial 911 will get messaged a link with information on the
situation, emergency exit locations and other lifesaving information.
